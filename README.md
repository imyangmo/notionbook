## What is NotionBook and why NotionBook
Many of us have had needs to write some documents, maybe for a project, maybe even for yourself as some kind of knowleage management system.

There was plenty of good free and open-source projects, one of them is Gitbook. I've tried some, but I am not going explain why I don't use them anymore here.

NotionBook uses Notion as writing platform, and transforms a Notion page into a Gitbook-like wiki site. It:
 - Has better writing experience: Because it uses Notion, one of the best writing platform I've ever used;
 - Supports most of the styles: It can displays your documents more wiki-like;
 - Is Free & Open-source
 - Controls by You: You are one hosting your site.

Please take note: 
I am not a professional developer, this project was written as a hobby.
You are more than welcome to make this project better.

NotionBook is an variant of [NotionPaper](https://github.com/imyangmo/notionpaper_ssr).
